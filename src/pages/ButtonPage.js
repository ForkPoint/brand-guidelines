       The target page to be accessed or the action to be triggered is shown on the buttons by means of a label in ForkPoint Type Wide Normal or
        else by an icon, or by a combination of the two. Good button labels are formulated in a way that is brief and precise. They tell the
         user exactly what action will be taken when the button is clicked. Buttons provide visual feedback when clicked or tapped,
       in the form of a response effect, providing that the buttons are not deactivated."
